# Welcome to my GitHub pages

I fell in love with MarkDown very quickly so I always wanted to be able to publish something that I had created using MarkDown. When I found this (Thank you Scott Hanselman) I knew I want to try it.

## So what will I be trying this out for?

Trying something new is a good thing. Go see my [About Mats](About_mats.md) page.
I will try to use this as my [blog](Test_blog_page.md)
